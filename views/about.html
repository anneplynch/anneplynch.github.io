        <div> Anne is a born and raised Texan whose love for creating stories and environments began at a young age. She spent all of her free time poring over her drawing table, devouring books and giving elaborate back stories to any inanimate object she could find. She completed her BS in Visualization at Texas A&amp;M University in 2013 and is currently pursuing her MFA in Visualization at Texas A&amp;M. During her time in school, Anne has explored a variety of subjects ranging from traditional art to computer graphics to game design. Outside her own studies, Anne discovered her passion for teaching and leadership by co-founding two organizations with her peers; the Texas A&amp;M SIGGRAPH Student Chapter, which is recognized as the largest and most active student chapter in the nation, and the current, largest student directed game jam in North America, the Chillennium Game Jam. She most recently worked as a 3D artist in the LIVE Lab, an on campus research/gaming studio, and is in her third year of cultivating young minds as a graduate instructor at Texas A&amp;M.

    <div style="">​Anne is at home working in the CG pipeline but has other artistic interests including painting, videography and gaming. In the past few years, she has been diving into procedural asset and shader creation and is curious to see their lasting effects on our industry. Her work has been shown nationally and internationally, spanning everywhere from Vancouver to Texas to Australia. Her current thesis work is inspired by memory and environments and she is presently asking questions about how memories can be triggered with art as the catalyst. Anne strives to continue exploring new places, meeting new people, and using both as influences to make future work.​Anne is at home working in the CG pipeline but has other artistic interests including painting, videography and gaming.
